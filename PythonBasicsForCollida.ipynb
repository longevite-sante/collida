Metzger IV,1 Saumil Sethna,1 and Noah Davidsohn1\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAging is a complex progression of changes best characterized as the chronic dysregulation of cellular processes leading\\nto deteriorated tissue and organ function. Although aging cannot currently be prevented, its impact on life- and\\nhealthspan in the elderly can potentially be minimized by interventions that aim to return these cellular processes to\\noptimal function. Recent studies have demonstrated that partial reprogramming using the Yamanaka factors (or a\\nsubset; OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4; OSK) can reverse age-related changes in vitro and in vivo. However, it is still\\nunknown whether the Yamanaka factors (or a subset) are capable of extending the lifespan of aged wild-type (WT)\\nmice. In this study, we show that systemically delivered adeno-associated viruses, encoding an inducible OSK system,\\nin 124-week-old male mice extend the median remaining lifespan by 109% over WT controls and enhance several\\nhealth parameters. Importantly, we observed a signiﬁcant improvement in frailty scores indicating that we were able to\\nimprove the healthspan along with increasing the lifespan. Furthermore, in human keratinocytes expressing exogenous\\nOSK, we observed signiﬁcant epigenetic markers of age reversal, suggesting a potential reregulation of genetic\\nnetworks to a younger potentially healthier state. Together, these results may have important implications for the\\ndevelopment of partial reprogramming interventions to reverse age-associated diseases in the elderly.\\n\\nKeywords: AAV, OSK, epigenetic, gene therapy, age reversal\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nT he world’s population is growing older, with a\\n\\ndoubling of the median age from 1900 to 2020, leading\\nto increased societal burden (Partridge et al., 2018). Aging\\nis the strongest risk factor for most common human dis-\\neases (Partridge, 2014), hence it is imperative to identify\\nantiaging interventions to delay or even potentially reverse\\nthe aging process. Increasing longevity has historically\\nreferred to extending the ‘‘lifespan’’ of an organism\\nthrough various interventions such as public health policies\\n(Merrill, 2014), caloric restriction (de Cabo et al., 2014;\\nLo´pez-Otı´n et al., 2013; Swindell, 2012), or\\nthrough\\n\\npharmaceutical interventions (Blagosklonny, 2019; Gloss-\\nmann and Lutz, 2019).\\n\\nOne potential pitfall of increasing longevity is that it may\\nnot necessarily improve quality of life or healthspan. For\\nexample, an organism might live longer but still undergo\\nage-related diseases and physiological decline, although\\nover an extended period. In contrast, age reversal involves\\nrestoring an organism to a younger state, counteracting the\\neffects of aging at the cellular level, and, consequently,\\nimproving both health- and lifespan.\\n\\nThe other pitfall of longevity research is cycle time. For\\nassessment and development of potentially efﬁcacious in-\\nterventions, it would necessitate waiting for the organism to\\n\\n1Rejuvenate Bio, San Diego, California, USA.\\n2Department of Biology, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.\\nª Carolina Cano Macip, et al., 2024.

Many groups are working to elucidate biomarkers that\\nare sensitive and correlate reliably with increased lifespan\\n(Horvath, 2013; Horvath and Raj, 2018; Hsu et al., 2020),\\nyet the current gold standard remains ‘‘time to death.’’ This\\nreadout works well for short-lived multicellular model or-\\nganisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans (*3 weeks)\\n(Zhang et al., 2020) and Drosophila melanogaster (*70\\ndays) (Piper and Partridge, 2018). At\\nthe mouse level,\\ntesting antiaging interventions can take 0.5 to 3 years.\\n\\nUsing a cocktail of transcription factors, OCT4 (O), SOX2\\n(S), KLF4 (K), and c-MYC (M), collectively known as\\nOSKM or Yamanaka factors, seminal studies showed that\\nsomatic cells can be reversed to a pluripotent state (Taka-\\nhashi and Yamanaka, 2006), thereby reversing a long-held\\nparadigm of unidirectional differentiation. By short or cyclic\\ninduction of the Yamanaka factors in transgenic mice, inves-\\ntigators have demonstrated age extension in progeroid mice.\\nThese transgenic mouse models encoded a polycistronic\\nOSKM cassette driven by a reverse tetracycline transactivator\\n(rtTA) (4F mice); cyclic administration of doxycycline led to\\npartial reprogramming without teratoma formation.\\n\\nThis paradigm partially ameliorated aging phenotypes\\nand extended the lifespan in the 4F-progeroid model\\n(Ocampo et al., 2016). Further studies showed that the\\nepigenetic proﬁle assessed by epigenetic methylation clocks\\n(Browder et al., 2022; Chondronasiou et al., 2022; Horvath,\\n2013; Horvath and Raj, 2018) was rejuvenated by cyclic\\nOSKM induction in several tissues, correlated with their\\nimproved function. Another study demonstrated that short\\ninduction of OSKM in a myocardial infarction model alle-\\nviated myocardial damage and improved cardiac function\\n(Chen et al., 2021).\\n\\nThe translation of these proof-of-concept genetic studies\\ninto therapeutic interventions holds promise for the growing\\naging population but encounters two signiﬁcant challenges:\\n(1) c-Myc (M) in the OSKM cocktail is an oncogene, and its\\noverexpression can lead to the development of tumors and\\n(2) OSKM is too large to be accommodated within existing\\ntherapeutic delivery approaches, such as adeno-associated\\nviruses (AAVs).\\n\\nThe aforementioned challenges were effectively ad-\\ndressed by another previous study (Lu et al., 2020), dem-\\nonstrating the dispensability of c-Myc for rejuvenation,\\nallowing OSK to be packaged into AAV as a single poly-\\ncistron. When packaged by AAV2 capsid and delivered\\nintravenously to the eye, AAV–OSK presents the ability to\\nrejuvenate transcriptome and methylome in retinal ganglion\\ncells, leading to axon regeneration and vision restoration in\\naged and glaucoma mice (Lu et al., 2020) and recently in\\nnonhuman primates of NAION disease (Ksander et al.,\\n2023).\\n\\nAge-related histone markers were reversed by OSK in the\\nkidney and muscle (Yang et al., 2023), and continued long-\\nterm OSK expression through AAV in the eye or liver was\\nostensibly safe for up to 21 months (Karg et al., 2023; Lu\\net al., 2020).\\n\\nHowever, the critical question of whether partial repro-\\ngramming can extend lifespan in wild-type (WT) animals\\nremains unaddressed, highlighting the urgent need for in-\\nvestigation, preferably through a therapeutically feasible\\nmethod. In support of this endeavor, we independently\\ngenerated a systemically delivered two-part AAV system\\n\\nwith doxycycline-inducible OSK. By cyclic induction of\\nAAV9-mediated OSK expression in 2-year-old WT mice,\\nwe observed a remarkable 109% increase in median re-\\nmaining life with improved health condition relative to\\ndoxycycline-treated control mice. Moreover, we showed\\nthat such treatments lead to profound age reversal in the\\nheart and liver tissues, as well as human keratinocytes, as\\nassessed by DNA methylation clocks.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nVector and AAV generation\\n\\nConstructs containing tetracycline-responsive element\\nversion 3 (TRE3) promoter driving the expression of human\\nOCT3/4, SOX2, and KLF4 from a polycistronic transcript\\n(TRE3-OSK) and second construct encoding rtTA version 4\\ndriven by hEf1a promoter (hEf1a-rtTA4) were generated by\\nGenscript (Piscataway, NJ) as reported previously (Lu et al.,\\n2020). The constructs were packaged in AAV9 capsid to\\ngenerate AAV9.TRE3-OSK-SV40pA (1.556 E13 vg/mL)\\nand AAV9-hEf1a-rtTA4-Sv40pA (1.88 E13 vg/mL) by\\nSignaGen (Fredrick, MD).\\n\\nMouse studies and frailty scores\\n\\nMouse experiments were performed at Jax laboratories\\n(AUS protocol #19063). Male C57BL6/J ( JAX Stock#\\n000664) mice aged to 124 weeks were injected with the two\\nviruses described above: each 1E12 vg/mouse (in 100 lL\\nvolume) through retro-orbital route. Control mice were in-\\njected with 100 lL formulation buffer (phosphate buffered\\nsaline [PBS]). Doxycycline induction was performed 1 week\\non/1 week off for the duration of the study, by providing\\n2 mg/mL ﬁnal concentration of doxycycline in drinking\\nwater, same as prior AAV–OSK study (Lu et al., 2020).\\n\\nControl mice received doxycycline in water at the same\\nconcentration as the vector-injected mice. The euthanasia\\ncriteria were as follows: a rapid or sustained deterioration in\\nhealth status resulting in a body condition score of £2; tu-\\nmors or other masses that become ulcerated or interfere with\\nthe ability of the animal to eat, drink, or ambulate; any pro-\\nlapsed organs that cannot be reduced and/or become ulcerated\\nand/or necrotic; any other condition that interferes with ability\\nto reach or consume adequate amounts of food or water.\\n\\nMice were individually weighed and assessed across 28\\ndifferent variables including physical, physiological, and\\ninnate reﬂex conditions,\\nincluding simple sensorial and\\nmotor tests, body temperature, and overall body condition\\nassessment.

A more tightly\\nregulated version of rtTA (rtTA4) was employed due to its\\nsuperior performance in minimizing leaky liver expression\\nin the absence of doxycycline and faster on/off switching\\ncompared with the traditional rtTA3 (Sinclair et al., 2021).\\nWe selected AAV9 capsid and EF1a promoter to ensure\\nmaximal distribution to most tissues (Inagaki et al., 2006\\nand Supplementary Table S1). We injected 124-week-old\\nWT C57BL6/J mice retro-orbitally with 100 lL containing\\neither PBS (formulation buffer) or 1E12 vg of each vector\\nfor a total dose of *6E13 vg/kg. We initiated the doxycy-\\ncline induction for both the control and AAV–OSK admin-\\nistered groups the day after injections and alternated weekly\\non/off cycles for the remainder of the animals’ lives (details\\ngiven in Materials and Methods section).\\n\\nDoxycycline-treated control mice had a median lifespan\\nof *133 weeks, whereas the TRE-OSK mice had a median\\nlifespan of 142.5 weeks (Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Fig. S1):\\na remarkable 109% extension in median remaining life in re-\\nsponse to OSK expression (control mice had 8.86 weeks of life\\nremaining vs. 18.5 weeks for TRE-OSK mice). We further\\ncompared the control doxycycline-treated mice with the his-\\ntorical published data for BL6/J mice (Yuan et al., 2012) and\\navailable through the mouse phenome database (https://\\nphenome.jax.org/projects/Yuan2); we found no signiﬁcant\\ndifferences in median survival, suggesting that doxycycline\\nalone had no adverse nor advantageous effects (Fig. 1b).\\n\\nIn addition, a previous report has demonstrated that control\\nAAV9 expressing GFP at\\nthe same dose we used\\n(2e12vg/mouse) does not alter median lifespan when admin-\\nistered to 2-year-old mice (Bernardes de Jesus et al., 2012).\\nAging is associated with an increased susceptibility to\\nadverse health outcomes that can be captured by clinicians\\nusing a FI, where people are scored based on a subset of\\nage-related health deﬁcits. High compound scores reﬂect a\\nfrail state and increased susceptibility to poor health out-\\ncomes (Searle et al., 2008).

We observed a signiﬁcant re-\\nduction in the FI from 7.5 points for doxycycline-treated\\ncontrol mice to 6 points for TRE-OSK mice (Fig. 1d,\\np = 0.0027), suggesting that increased lifespan correlated\\nwith overall better health of the animals.\\n\\nMolecular measures of cellular and tissue health have been\\ndeveloped based on methylation patterns of genomic DNA.\\n‘‘Epigenetic age,’’ a well characterized and established aging\\nbiomarker, can be calculated using these methylation pat-\\nterns. Such epigenetic clock biomarkers decouple chrono-\\nlogical age (Bell et al., 2019) from the functional state of the\\ncells or tissues, while correlating better to aging, disease\\nstate(s), and health outcomes (Bell et al., 2019; Durso et al.,\\n2017; Fransquet et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2021).\\n\\nMatching with previous reports of AAV9 tissue tropism\\n(Supplementary Table S1), we observed that high OSK\\nexpression in the liver and heart, but contrary to AAV9,\\nfailed to see high expression levels in the brain of mice that\\n\\nreceived AAV9-EF1a-rtTA4 and TRE-OSK (Supplementary\\nFig. S2). The lack of brain expression of OSK is likely to\\nlow cotransduction of dual AAVs and lower DOX pene-\\ntration. Therefore, we isolated DNA from heart and liver\\ntissue from control and TRE-OSK-treated mice at time of\\ndeath and measured the epigenetic age with the LUC clock,\\nwhich correlates age-related CpGs with maximum lifespan\\n(Browder et al., 2022; Haghani et al., 2022). Both liver and\\nheart from the OSK treatment group have signiﬁcantly re-\\nduced epigenetic age compared with control (Fig. 2a).\\n\\nTo assess the rejuvenation effects of OSK overexpression\\nin human cells, we expressed OSK in HEK001 keratinocytes\\nisolated from the scalp of a 65-year-old male patient, even\\nthough this cell line has been immortalized to prevent rep-\\nlicative senescence, several studies by the Steven Horvath\\nand Ken Raj group show that the increase of DNAm age is\\nnot prevented by immortalization (Kabacik et al., 2022;\\nKabacik et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018).

Taken to-\\ngether, our mouse and keratinocytes data suggest that AAV-\\nmediated gene therapy delivering OSK increases lifespan in\\nmice with improved health parameters and reverses bio-\\nmarkers of aging in mouse and human cells.\\n\\nThe necessity for cotransduction of both AAVs (EF1a-\\nrtTA4 and TRE-OSK) into the same cell could potentially\\nlimit tissue distribution, hindering the observation of more\\nextensive whole-body rejuvenation and a greater extension of\\nlifespan. Considering the safety of continued OSK expression\\nthrough AAV in the eye or liver for up to 21 months (Karg\\net al., 2023; Lu et al., 2020), coupled with sustained vision\\nimprovement surpassing that of a cyclic OSK regimen (Karg\\net al., 2023), we engineered a single noninducible AAV\\nvector (pAAV-CMV-OSK) to explore its potential to reach\\ntissues in aged mice with reduced AAV titers.\\n\\nRemarkably, using 1/10th of\\n\\nthe AAV at 1.7e11\\nvg/mouse, we observed robust OSK expression in the liver,\\nheart, and spleen of both 8-week-old and 82-week-old mice\\n(Fig. 3). This encourages further investigation into the\\nnoninducible single OSK AAV’s capacity to rejuvenate\\ntissues and its impact on lifespan in future studies.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nIn modern societies, aging is the highest risk factor as-\\nsociated with most diseases and mortality (Partridge, 2014).\\nThe goals of regenerative medicine are to improve tissue\\n\\nand organ function and to correct disease states. Cellular\\nrejuvenation through partial reprogramming has been shown\\nto be a promising avenue to achieve the goals of regenera-\\ntive medicine, as it targets the epigenetic information loss\\nduring aging and injury (Lu et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023).\\nHere we show that in human cells, exogenous expression of\\nan OSK leads to profound age reversal as observed by the\\nrestoration of genomic methylation patterns to those that are\\ncharacteristic of younger cells, a validated hallmark of\\nchronological age reversal (Bell et al., 2019; Haghani et al.,\\n2022; Xiao et al., 2021).\\n\\nTo our knowledge, we have shown for the ﬁrst time an\\nextension of remaining median lifespan in extremely old\\nWT C57BL6/J mice concomitantly with improved health\\noutcomes as a consequence of a systemic AAV-based partial\\nreprogramming therapy. Experiments to assess the epige-\\nnetic programming hallmarks in speciﬁc tissues, along with\\nthorough analysis of the RNA proﬁles at single cell level\\n(Roux et al., 2022), will be required to make broader con-\\nclusions as to which pathways are reprogrammed to a more\\nyouthful state.\\n\\nTeratoma formation has been observed in partially re-\\nprogrammed animals, particularly when c-Myc is used in the\\npartial rejuvenation cocktail (Abad et al., 2013; Ocampo\\net al., 2016; Ohnishi et al., 2014; Senı´s et al., 2018). Al-\\nthough poorly invasive and poorly metastatic,\\nteratoma\\nformation is unlikely to be accepted by the FDA, hence tight\\ncontrol of the partial rejuvenation factors will be a key at-\\ntribute for safe and efﬁcacious rejuvenation therapies. We\\ndid not notice any gross teratoma formation when we pro-\\ncessed the tissues from animals receiving AAV9-EF1a-\\nrtTA4; TRE-OSK or AAV9-CMV-OSK, or during the frailty\\nscore measurement (Supplementary Table S2).\\n\\n\\x0cPage 6\\n-\\no\\nr\\nt\\ne\\nr\\n\\ne\\nc\\ni\\nm\\n\\n)\\nd\\nl\\nO\\n\\n(\\n\\nd\\nl\\no\\n-\\nk\\ne\\ne\\nw\\n-\\n2\\n8\\n\\nd\\nn\\na\\n\\n)\\ng\\nn\\nu\\no\\nY\\n\\n(\\n\\nd\\nl\\no\\n-\\nk\\ne\\ne\\nw\\n-\\n8\\nm\\no\\nr\\nf\\n\\n4\\nf\\nl\\n\\nK\\nd\\nn\\na\\n\\n,\\n\\n2\\nx\\no\\nS\\n\\n,\\n\\n4\\nt\\nc\\nO\\n\\nf\\no\\nR\\nC\\nP\\nq\\n\\n.\\ne\\nc\\ni\\nm\\nd\\ne\\ng\\na\\n\\nd\\nn\\na\\n\\ng\\nn\\nu\\no\\ny\\n\\nf\\no\\n\\ns\\ne\\nu\\ns\\ns\\ni\\nt\\n\\nn\\ni\\n\\nn\\no\\ni\\ns\\ns\\ne\\nr\\np\\nx\\ne\\nK\\nS\\nO\\nV\\nM\\nC\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n9\\nV\\nA\\nA\\n\\n.\\n3\\n\\n.\\n\\nG\\nI\\nF\\n\\n29\\n\\n.\\ne\\nn\\ni\\nl\\na\\ns\\n\\nd\\ne\\nr\\ne\\nf\\nf\\nu\\nb\\n\\ne\\nt\\na\\nh\\np\\ns\\no\\nh\\np\\n\\n,\\n\\nS\\nB\\nP\\n\\nd\\ne\\nz\\ni\\nl\\na\\nm\\nr\\no\\nn\\n\\ns\\ni\\n\\ne\\nn\\ne\\ng\\n\\nh\\nc\\na\\ne\\n\\nf\\no\\n\\nl\\ne\\nv\\ne\\nL\\n\\n.\\n\\nn\\no\\ni\\nt\\nc\\ne\\nj\\nn\\ni\\n\\nr\\ne\\nt\\nf\\na\\n\\ns\\nk\\ne\\ne\\nw\\n2\\n1\\n\\nd\\ne\\nt\\nc\\ne\\nl\\nl\\no\\nc\\n\\ne\\nr\\ne\\nw\\ns\\ne\\nu\\ns\\ns\\ni\\nt\\n\\nt\\nn\\ne\\nr\\ne\\nf\\nf\\ni\\nd\\n\\nx\\ni\\ns\\n\\n,\\ns\\nl\\no\\nr\\nt\\nn\\no\\nc\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n5\\n0\\n0\\n<\\np\\n*\\n*\\n\\n.\\ns\\nn\\no\\ns\\ni\\nr\\na\\np\\nm\\no\\nc\\n\\ne\\nl\\np\\ni\\nt\\nl\\nu\\nm\\n\\ns\\n’\\nk\\na´\\nd\\nı´\\nSˇ\\n–\\nm\\nl\\no\\nH\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nd\\ne\\nt\\nc\\ne\\nf\\nn\\ni\\nn\\nu\\n\\nd\\nn\\na\\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\no\\nm\\n/\\ng\\nv\\n\\n1\\n1\\ne\\n7\\n1\\n\\n.\\n\\n9\\nV\\nA\\nA\\ne\\nh\\nt\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nw\\nd\\ne\\nt\\nc\\ne\\nj\\nn\\ni\\n\\ny\\nl\\nl\\na\\nt\\ni\\nb\\nr\\no\\n\\nw\\n\\nt\\ns\\ne\\nt\\n\\ny\\ne\\nn\\nt\\ni\\nh\\nW\\n–\\nn\\nn\\na\\nM\\ne\\nl\\np\\ni\\nt\\nl\\nu\\nM\\n\\n.\\n\\nS\\nB\\nP\\n\\ng\\nn\\ni\\nv\\ni\\ne\\nc\\ne\\nr\\n\\ns\\nl\\no\\nr\\nt\\nn\\no\\nc\\n\\nf\\no\\n\\nt\\na\\nh\\nt\\n\\no\\nt\\n\\n\\x0cPage 7\\n30\\n\\nCANO MACIP ET AL.\\n\\nThese observations, along with recent advances in vector\\ndevelopment and optimization,\\ntissue-speciﬁc promoters,\\nand inducible systems (Domenger and Grimm, 2019; Li and\\nSamulski, 2020), engender cautious optimism that a partial\\nrejuvenation therapy can be safely delivered in humans.\\nPrudent and thorough monitoring studies in large animals\\nwill be required to assess the safety and efﬁcacy of partial\\nrejuvenation studies.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank Bailey Bonet, Mehdi Doroudchi, Chris Liu,\\nMuralidhar Reddivari, and Chris de Solis for critical reading\\nand suggestions of the article.

For\\ntherapeutic development in humans, having three separate\\nvectors\\nof\\nmanufacturing, drug product speciﬁcations, and adminis-\\ntration protocols for clinical development.\\n\\nsigniﬁcantly\\n\\nincreases\\n\\nthe\\n\\ncomplexity\\n\\nBased on our novel proof-of-concept studies in an ex-\\ntremely aged mouse population (equivalent to >80 years of\\nage in humans) and previous studies in younger mice\\n(Browder et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2020; Ocampo et al., 2016),\\nwe envision therapeutic rejuvenation in aged humans, ﬁrst\\nin a speciﬁc age-related disease setting and later for thera-\\npeutic healthspan and lifespan extension.\\n\\nLimitation of the study\\n\\nAlthough we showed a lifespan extension with AAV–\\nOSK compared with DOX-treated control mice and JAX\\nhistorical mice lifespan, it would be ideal to have an addi-\\ntional control group of AAV scramble or AAV-GFP to rule\\nout any potential effect of AAV. That said, previous report\\nhas already demonstrated that control AAV (AAV9-GFP)\\ninfection (at the same dose used in this study) in 2-year-old\\nmice does not alter median lifespan at all (Bernardes de\\nJesus et al., 2012). Due to a limited availability of aged\\nfemale mice, we focused our investigation solely on male\\nsubjects.\\n\\nWe examined AAV expression in limited tissues from\\nmice in the lifespan study, from the combined consequences\\nof a cyclic induction protocol and allowing the mice to reach\\na humane endpoint resulted in most mice being found dead\\ninstead of euthanized. The cyclic induction protocol meant\\nthat at any given time a mouse died, only half the mice are\\nexpressing OSK and even less than that are maximally ex-\\npressing OSK, as maximal expression would only be\\nachieved on day 7 of Dox induction. However, we were still\\nable to observe some expression in liver and heart, and our\\nsingle constitutive AAV–OSK vector tissue distribution data\\nsuggest additional spleen expression (Fig. 3).\\n\\nOther data from published literature on AAV9 tissue\\ntropism suggest that there are potentially more tissues with\\nOSK transduction, however, the need for coinfection and\\ndoxycycline bioavailability appears to further limit which\\ntissues can overexpress OSK (Supplementary Table S1).\\nA more deﬁnitive examination should involve tissue distri-\\nbution examination with luciferase, replacing OSK (Liao\\net al., 2017; Lu et al., 2020). Future studies can investigate\\nthis aspect to help design vectors that can more systemically\\nreverse tissue age.\\n\\nAuthors’ Contributions\\n\\nC.C.M., R.H., V.H., J.K., L.E.M., S.S., and N.D. all\\nperformed work on the project through assay validation,\\nvirus production, sample preparation, sample analysis, tissue\\nprocessing, and writing of the article.
